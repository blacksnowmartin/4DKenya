# 4DKenya
“This project creates the first Kenyan-built 4D computational prototyping engine — a tool that allows scientists, engineers, and innovators to simulate interactions in higher-dimensional spaces. This opens unexplored frontiers for future technologies such as teleportation, ultra-efficient routing, quantum architectures, and advanced materials.”
